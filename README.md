## Car Price Predictor üöóüí∞
This Car Price Predictor project is a supervised machine learning application that uses a labeled dataset to predict the selling price of cars based on several key features. The primary goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate car prices using regression techniques and relevant data preprocessing.

## Project Overview üìã
In this project, I used RandomForestRegressor to predict car prices, selected based on its performance compared to other models. Here‚Äôs a summary of the steps and techniques applied:

## Dataset Preparation and Feature Engineering üìä
Dataset: Contains labeled data with the target variable Selling_Price and input features like:
Fuel Type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric)
Seller Type (Dealer, Individual)
Car Name
Kms Driven (Total distance traveled by the car)
Label Encoding: Since features like fuel_type, seller_type, and car_name are categorical, I used label encoding to convert them into numeric format. This conversion enables the model to understand and utilize the categorical information effectively during training.
Feature Scaling: Applied feature scaling to normalize the data, ensuring that all features fall within a fixed range, which can help with faster convergence and stability in training.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Correlation Analysis üîç
Heatmap Analysis: Used heatmaps to check if features were linearly correlated. This analysis helped determine whether linear regression models like LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet would be appropriate. In this case, the data showed non-linear correlations, leading me to explore alternative models.
## Model Selection and Evaluation üîç
Created a dictionary to test various regression models, including:
Linear Models: LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet
Tree-Based Models: DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor
Support Vector Machine: SVR
K-Nearest Neighbors: KNeighborsRegressor
Table of Results: Used the tabulate module to display model accuracy in a table for easy comparison. Based on accuracy, RandomForestRegressor provided the best results.
## Model Validation and Error Analysis ‚úÖ
Evaluated the model using key metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Checked these metrics to ensure minimal error between training and testing data, helping avoid issues like overfitting or underfitting.
Overfitting and Underfitting Check: Ensured that the model performed consistently well on both training and testing sets by comparing MSE and MAE values, indicating robust model performance.
## Final Testing and Predictions üéØ
Tested the final RandomForestRegressor model on new data, and the predictions were accurate, with results closely matching real-world selling prices. This result validated the effectiveness of the feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation process.
## Key Takeaways üìà
This project demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to predict car prices.
It highlights the importance of using appropriate encoding techniques for categorical data and the role of model evaluation metrics in building a reliable model.
The project reflects the application of regression techniques in a real-world scenario, showcasing my skills in machine learning and model tuning.
## Technologies and Libraries Used üõ†Ô∏è
Python: Programming language for building and testing the model.
Pandas and NumPy: For data handling and manipulation.
Scikit-Learn: For model building, feature scaling, and evaluation.
Tabulate: To display model accuracy comparisons in a readable table format.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization, especially the heatmap to analyze feature correlations.
## Conclusion üí°
This Car Price Predictor project showcases how machine learning techniques can be used to make accurate predictions based on historical data. By combining feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation, this project provides valuable insights into the car pricing landscape, creating a model that can be a valuable asset for users and businesses alike.
